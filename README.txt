# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
﻿
### Project Overview:
In this project, we will use Python and descriptive statistics to explore data on bike sharing systems in three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York, and Washington.
﻿
Using Python, we will answer some interesting basic statistical questions about the data.I will also write a script that takes raw input to create an interactive terminal experience for presenting these statistics.
﻿
### Bike Share Details:
In the past decade, bike sharing systems have become increasingly popular in cities around the world. These systems enable users to rent bicycles for short-term use at a certain cost, allowing them to borrow bicycles from point A and return them at point B. If they only want to ride, they can even return the bicycles to the same location.
Therefore, each bicycle can serve multiple users every day.
The dataset includes core columns: start time, end time, travel duration, start station, end station, and user type. (Additional columns for Chicago and New York: Gender, Year of Birth)
### Statistics Computed:
#### Popular Times of Travel:
* Most common month
* Most common day of the week
* Most common hour of the day
#### Popular Stations and Trips:
* Most common start station
* Most common end station
* Most common trip from start to end
#### Trip Duration:
* Total travel time
* Average travel time
#### User Info:
* Counts of each user type
* Counts of each gender (NYC and Chicago only)
* Earliest, most recent, and most common year of birth (NYC and Chicago only)
